The reason for this is that the Location concept from zib MedicalDevice aligns with the Location concept from zib Procedure, but only for the situation that the Procedure is about placing an implant which is described using the instance of zib MedicalDevice. In this situation, the extension in the nl-core-MedicalDevice profile is redundant and it is advised to only use the current element to represent the Location concept.",
