Title: "zib TreatmentObjective"
Description: "The treatment objective describes the desired result of the treatment/interventions in terms of the patientâ€™s diagnosed problem. The objective and target date are entered in addition to the target value. Comparing the healthcare results to the treatment objective provides insight into the effectivity of the treatment/interventions."
