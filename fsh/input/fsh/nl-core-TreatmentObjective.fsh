This profile augments the base profile with elements found in the various use cases that have adopted the zib.\n\nThis profile is a pre-adopt of the nl-core-TreatmentObjective profile that will be published by Nictiz in the next nl-core package.

  * ^comment = "On the zib level, zib TreatmentObjective uses a reference to zib FunctionalOrMentalStatus (in future context). In FHIR the concepts from FunctionalOrMentalStatus are represented directly in the the Goal resource, with the exception of the reference to zib MedicalDevice; this reference is represented by the core extension resource-pertainsToGoal in the [nl-core-MedicalDevice](http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-MedicalDevice) profile."
